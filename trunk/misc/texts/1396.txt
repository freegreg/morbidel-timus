Maximum. Version 2
Time Limit: 1.0 second
Memory Limit: 16 MB
Consider the sequence of numbers a[i], i = 0, 1, 2, ..., which satisfies the following requirments: 
 a[0] = 0
 a[1] = 1
 a[2i] = a[i]
 a[2i+1] = a[i] + a[i+1]
for every i=1, 2, 3, ... . 
Write a program which for a given value of N (0 < N < 1018) finds the largest number among the numbers a[0], a[1], ..., a[N]. 
Input
Input contains not more than 10000 lines containing one number N. The last line contains 0. 
Output
For every N in the input write the coresponding maximum value found. 
Sample Input
5
10
0
Sample Output
3
4
Hint
This problem is the same as “Maximum” but with bigger limitations.
