Average Common Prefix
Time Limit: 3.0 second
Memory Limit: 16 MB
Let T denote some string of length n consisting of capital Latin letters. Let Shift(T, k) denote the left cyclic shift of T by k-1 positions. The permutation array for T is an array P[1..n] such that Shift(T, P[1]), Shift(T, P[2]), ..., Shift(T, P[n]) is a list of cyclic shifts of T sorted in lexicographical order. 
For given two strings v and w we define LCP(v, w) as the length of their longest common prefix. The Average LCP of the string T is the average length of longest common prefix between two consecutive shifts: 
 
Example, T = 'MISSISSIPPI', n = 11: 
i	P[i]	Shift(T, P[i])	LCP
1	11	'IMISSISSIPP'	1
2	8	'IPPIMISSISS'	1
3	5	'ISSIPPIMISS'	4
4	2	'ISSISSIPPIM'	0
5	1	'MISSISSIPPI'	0
6	10	'PIMISSISSIP'	1
7	9	'PPIMISSISSI'	0
8	7	'SIPPIMISSIS'	2
9	4	'SISSIPPIMIS'	1
10	6	'SSIPPIMISSI'	3
11	3	'SSISSIPPIMI'	 
Average LCP of 'MISSISSIPPI' is 1.3 
Input
The first line of the input contains integer n (1 < n < 250001). The second line contains string T. 
Output
The only line of the output should contain the Average LCP of T with 3 digits after decimal point. 
Sample Input
11
MISSISSIPPI
Sample Output
1.300
