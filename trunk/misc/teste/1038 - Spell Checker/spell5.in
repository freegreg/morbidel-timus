  For typed files, reads a file
 component into a variable.
  For text files, reads one or more
 values into one or more variables

 Declaration:

 Target
Windows, Real, Protected

 Remarks:
With a type string variable:
  Read reads all characters up
 to, but not including, the next
   end-of-line marker or until
   EofF becomes True; it does not
   skip to the
   next line after reading. If
   the resulting string is longer than
   the
   maximum length of the string variable,
   it is truncated.
  After the first Read, each subsequent
 Read will see the end-of-line
   marker and return a zero-length
   string.

Use multiple Readln calls to read
successive
string values.

When the extended syntax
is enabled, Read can
read null-terminated strings into
zero-based
character arrays.

With type integer or type real
variables:
  Read will skip any blanks, tabs, or
 end-of-line markers preceding the
   numeric string.
  If the numeric string does not conform to the expected format, an I O
   error occurs, otherwise the value is assigned to the variable.
  The next Read will start with the blank, tab or end-of-line marker that
   terminated the numeric string.
